Hello Everyone!

Hopefully everything is going well during this semester. The PGSA is planning on holding a picnic on October 10th from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm. The venue is Crystal Lake park and food will be provided via boxed lunches (source TBD).

We're coordinating with Lance to ensure that proper guidelines will be followed so the plan might change, but the idea is to have some lunch, play some games (frisbee and volleyball) and just have a good time before it starts getting too cold.

If you want to come to the picnic, please fill out the following Google form by September 24th 4:00 pm, so that we get a headcount and dietary restriction of the attendees.
